        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-6">About the Program</h2>
        <p class="mb-4">
          I have been volunteering to help low income families and seniors file their tax returns for free through VAT/TCE. This program is designed to provide quality tax assistance at no cost to those who qualify.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
          Unfortunately, some applicants are rejected because certain income items or expenses fall outside the program‚Äôs eligibility guidelines.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
          To ensure everyone gets the help they need, I am working on offering a very low-cost alternative ‚Äì just above free ‚Äì so they can avoid being exploited by high fees from some greedy tax companies.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
          This initiative aims to empower individuals who might otherwise be left without support, ensuring fair access to essential tax services.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
       
        <p class="mt-4">
          This approach ensures that everyone, regardless of minor discrepancies in income or expenses, has access to affordable tax assistance.
